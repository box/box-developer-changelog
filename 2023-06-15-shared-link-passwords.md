# Enhanced passwords for Shared Links

We have enhanced our password policy for creating shared links with Box API, for example when [adding a shared link to a file][1].
Passwords must now be at least eight characters long and include:

* a number,
* upper case letter, or
* non-alphabetic or non-numeric character

<!-- more -->

## New place to get support

From now on you can ask questions and seek for guidance in our new [Box Developer Community forum][2]. Use this new space to  directly speak to the Box Developer Relations team, as well as your peers and other subject matter experts from Box.
