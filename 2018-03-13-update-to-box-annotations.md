# Update to Box Annotations

Due to performance issues reported by some users, the update has been rolled
back to prevent critical business applications from getting impacted. Drawing
Annotations and Point Annotations mode features have now been turned off. We do
not have an ETA for performance fixes or when these features will be
re-enabled. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

Users who used the Drawing Annotations capability while it was available will
still be able to access their annotations once the feature Edit. Documentation
is re-enabled. Until then, the said annotations will be stored in our
application data store but wonâ€™t be exposed via the viewers.
