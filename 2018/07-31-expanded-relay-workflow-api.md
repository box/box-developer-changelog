# Expanded Relay Workflow API

We have expanded the capabilities of [Box Relay][box_relay], a workflow tool
co-developed between Box and IBM, with a new Workflow API. The Relay Workflow
API allows you to launch Box Relay workflows and retrieve the statuses of those
workflows from within your application. It also allows you to view which
workflow templates have been published in file directly into your instance of
Box Relay. For more information about the API, please see our
[announcement blog post][box_relay_announce].
