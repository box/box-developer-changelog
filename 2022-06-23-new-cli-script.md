# Automate tasks with Box CLI and scripts library

The [Box CLI][3] now features a sample scripts library with templates you can use to automate your tasks.
For starters, we wanted to provide you with a PowerShell script that allows you to:
* set up a folder structure
* create managed users
* add the users to the folder structure as collaborators

<!-- more -->

## Updates

* The Box CLI [quick start guide][4] now provides instructions on using a PowerShell script to create a folder structure and users.
* The [scripts library][5] is a go to place where you can find all sample scripts. Currently, it includes the PowerShell script but more samples are on the way!
