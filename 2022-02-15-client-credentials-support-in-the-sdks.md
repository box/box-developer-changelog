# Client Credentials support in the SDKs

Our [`.NET` SDK][3] now supports Client Credentials. We plan to release the support for the other SDKs in the coming weeks.

<!-- more -->

Back in November 2020, we released a new authentication type for custom applications
called Client Credentials. Today, we have started releasing SDK support for the new type.

## Updates

* Added new sample tag and example on our [Client Credentials guide page][4].

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][1] for any help needed.
