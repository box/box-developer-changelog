# New Shield Download Event

Today, we released a new `event_type` to the [Enterprise Event][events] stream
for downloads that are restricted based on a Shield access policy.

<!-- more -->

If an admin creates a shield access policy that restricts downloads and an
end user is blocked from downloading a file, an event is produced
within the [enterprise event][events] stream. Events will also be generated
when a user is viewing a folder with a file restricted from download, viewing a
file in preview that is restricted from download, and when a user requests to
download a file through the API that is restricted from download. These events
follow the standard event object schema and the `event_type` value set
to `SHIELD_DOWNLOAD_BLOCKED`.

## Updates

* Added a [new section][new-event] to the Smart Access event trigger documentation
* Added `SHIELD_DOWNLOAD_BLOCKED` to the [enterprise event list][event-list]

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][forum] for any help needed.
