# Metadata view `v2` in Content Explorer

We introduced `v2` of the [metadata view in the Box Content Explorer][1] UI element.
It's a ground-up redesign of the original version, introducing a streamlined interface tailored for metadata-driven workflows.

## Key features

* filtering and editing interfaces with dedicated UI for each metadata field type,
* flexible display options with list and grid views,
* pagination support.

<!-- more -->

## Migration from `v1` to `v2`

The `v1` of the metadata view Content Explorer has reached end of support and it will no longer receive bug fixes or new features.
We recommend to migrate to the new `v2` metadata view. See the [migration guide][3] for a detailed instruction.

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to our [developer forum][2] for any help needed.
