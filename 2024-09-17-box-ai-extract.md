# Metadata extraction with Box AI API now available in Beta

With its recent addition, Box AI API allows you to extract metadata from the provided input.
For example you can extract the financial information from an invoice, or patient data from a medical certificate.

> **Note**: Box AI API is currently a beta feature offered subject to Boxâ€™s Main Beta Agreement, and the available capabilities may change. Box AI API is available to all Enterprise Plus customers.

<!-- more -->

You have the following options:

[`POST /2.0/ai_extract`][1] endpoint allows you to extract metadata from the provided file in a freeform way.
This means you have more freedom in creating the prompt, and the metadata template is not required to run the request.
[`POST /2.0/ai_extract_structured`][2] endpoint allows you to extract metadata from the provided file using a [metadata template][3] or `fields` structure.
