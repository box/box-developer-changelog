# New Folder Lock APIs now available

A new collections of APIs have been released to allow developers to lock move
and delete operations on folders. New [API reference][e_post] and
[guides][g_post] have been made available to help create and manage you folder
locks.

To create a lock on a folder to prevent it from being moved or deleted, supply
the ID of a folder to the `folder_locks` endpoint.

```curl
curl -i -X POST "https://api.box.com/2.0/folder_locks" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "folder": {
         "type": "folder",
         "id": "33552487093"
       }
     }'
```

Additional API endpoints are available to allow a developer to list all locks
on a given folder, or to delete an existing folder lock with a folder lock ID.
