# Introducing Beta Release: New Generation Python SDK

We are excited to introduce [the latest generation (currently in Beta) of Box Python SDK][1], designed to elevate the developer experience and streamline your integration with the Box Content Cloud.

With the [new generation of Python SDK][1], you'll have access to:

* **Full API Support**: The new generation of Box SDKs empowers developers with complete coverage of the Box API ecosystem. You can now access all the latest features and functionalities offered by Box, allowing you to build even more sophisticated and feature-rich applications.
* **Rapid API Updates** your applications without delay.
* **Embedded Documentation**: We understand that access to information is crucial for developers. With our new approach, we have included comprehensive documentation for all objects and parameters directly in the source code of the SDK. This means you no longer need to look up this information on the developer portal, saving you time and streamlining your development process.
* **Enhanced Convenience Methods**: Our commitment to enhancing your development experience continues with the introduction of convenience methods. These methods cover various aspects such as authentication, chunk uploads, exponential back-offs, automatic retries, type checkers which help to ensure that youâ€™re using variables correctly, and much more.

Embrace the new generation of Box SDKs and unlock the full potential of the Box Content Cloud. Start building innovative solutions faster and more efficiently. Happy coding!
