# Refreshed Postman Collection & Quick Start

The Box Postman collection has been updated with new features and an integrated
quick-start guide. Key features include:

* An end-to-end [Postman quick-start guide][postman-quick-start-guide] that
  helps users to install Postman, set up a Box App, and load their API
  credentials into Postman.
* A [restructured Postman collection][postman-collection] for the Box APIs that
  automatically detects when API credentials have expired and offers integrated
  solutions for refreshing these credentials when needed.

The [legacy Postman collection][legacy-postman-collection] will stay available
for the foreseeable future.
