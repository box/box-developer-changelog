# AI Studio v2

With the release of the newest version of the AI Studio functionality, we introduced the [enhancements][1] listed below.

**Users** receive a notification in case of any issues with an agent directly in the AI Studio UI. An agent validation happens in real time.

**Admins** can:

* Control the suggested questions displayed when the user starts interacting with a custom AI agent.
* See the details of a request and response of a LLM, for example the system prompt, model, custom instructions.
* Control the parameters of a Box AI image processor in a custom agent. The parameters are necessary to ask a LLM about a specific image.

<!-- more -->

You can find more information in our [API][1] and [product documentation][2].
