# Simplified App Creation Flow

A new, simplified app creation flow is now available in the Box
[Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console). The three
types of applications are Custom Apps, Limited Access Apps, and Box Custom
Skills.

We added plain language to describe exactly when to select each
app type and links to relevant documentation if you require additional
information to help with your selection. The application type you select impacts
which authentication methods are available.

Most notably, is our new app type, Limited Access Apps. Select this app type if
you'd like to leverage [Box View](g://embed/box-view/) or Box's preview services
within another application. This app type only provides access to
[app token authentication](g://authentication/app-token/), which has
[restricted API capabilities](g://authentication/app-token/endpoints/).
For full details, please visit our [guide](g://applications/app-types/select) on
selecting an app type.
