# Announcing End of Support for Android SDK on May 31st

As of May 31, 2023 [Android SDK][1] will no longer be supported. You can still use your existing Android SDK applications with no impact, but you won't receive new features, updates, or bug fixes.
If you would like to continue getting the latest and greatest Android features, we recommend using Java SDK to build apps on Android. Refer to [this][2] documentation for more details.
