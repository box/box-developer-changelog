# Node SDK `v1.32.0` released

* Temporarily removed Node 4 and Node 5 builds from Travis, due to tests not passing.  Will investigate, going forward ([#495](https://github.com/box/box-node-sdk/pull/495)). [`dc558e9`](https://github.com/box/box-node-sdk/commit/dc558e9)
* Fixed an issue where an error is thrown during a retry when a response is not returned by the previous call  ([#477](https://github.com/box/box-node-sdk/pull/477)). [`f1b3449`](https://github.com/box/box-node-sdk/commit/f1b3449)
* Added the ability to [query](./docs/metadata.md#query) Box items based on their metadata ([#487](https://github.com/box/box-node-sdk/pull/487)). [`6f08931`](https://github.com/box/box-node-sdk/commit/6f08931)
