# Historical Platform Activity CSV report

A new report has been made available via the website. Documentation is available
in the Box Admin Console that displays an enterprise's historical utilization of
platform resources. This report displays an enterprise's Monthly Active Users,
API calls, and bandwidth consumption by application by month for
January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. More information can be found
[here][platform_activity_csv].
