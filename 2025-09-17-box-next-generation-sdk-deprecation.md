# Box Next Generation SDK deprecation

As of September 17, 2025 Box Next Generation SDKs are no longer supported as separate artifacts. Don’t worry, your existing code will continue to work without changes. You can still use your applications based on Box Next Generation SDKs with no impact, but you won't receive new features, updates, or bug fixes.

<!-- more -->

In keeping with industry best practices, we are consolidating the Box Next Generation SDKs and Box core SDKs into a single package for each programming language. This makes migration efforts much easier and allows seamless addition of new capabilities to existing applications still powered by Box core SDKs, which were maintained manually.

All future development, including new features and updates for the Next Generation SDKs, will be delivered through Box core SDKs starting with version `v10`. Currently, `v10` is available as a separate branch.

For more information and migration guides, see the [SDK versioning strategy document][versioning]. Follow the developer changelog for future updates.
