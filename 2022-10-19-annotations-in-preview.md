# New annotations in the Content Preview UI Element

To improve the content previewing experience, we have added support for new
annotations types in the Preview UI Element.
<!-- more -->

End users previewing content in custom applications can now utilize additional
annotation types, such as text highlight, drawing, and more. All the annotations
sync in real time.

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][1] for any help needed.
