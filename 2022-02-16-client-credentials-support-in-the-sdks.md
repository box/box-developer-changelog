# Client Credentials support in the SDKs

Our [`.NET`][3] and [`Java`][5] SDKs now support Client Credentials Grant
authentication. We plan to release the support for the other SDKs in the
coming weeks.

<!-- more -->

Back in November 2020, we released a new authentication type for custom
applications called Client Credentials. Today, we have started releasing SDK
support for the new type.

## Updates

* Added new sample tags and examples on our [Client Credentials guide page][4].

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][1] for any help needed.
