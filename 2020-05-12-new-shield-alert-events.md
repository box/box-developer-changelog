# New shield alert events

As of today, [Box Shield][box-shield] will begin producing new security events
within the [enterprise event stream](g://events/enterprise-events/for-enterprise/) for Shield
customers who are configured to listen for the new events.

The possible incident events produced by Shield are:

* Suspicious locations
* Suspicious sessions
* Anomalous download
* Malicious content

See the [shield alert events](g://events/event-triggers/shield-alert-events/) documentation
for more information on the payloads produced within these events.
