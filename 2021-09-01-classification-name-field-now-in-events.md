# Classification Name Field now in Events API

If a classification exists on content, the [events][events] API now
returns the classification `name` field in the response object.

<!-- more -->

* The updates to the event source response object can be
  seen [here][event-source].
* A new [guide page][event-triggers] has been added to show examples for an
  event triggered by a user source and an event source.

Below is an example of the response before and after the enhancement. Please
note that if a classification doesn't exist, the before example will still
be returned.

Before:

```js
{
  "source": {
    "item_type": "file",
    "item_id": "8903212345",
    "item_name": "example.docx",
    "parent": {
      "type": "folder",
      "name": "All Files",
      "id": "0"
    },
    "owned_by": {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "11446498",
      "name": "Aaron Levie",
      "login": "notifications@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

After:

```js
{
  "source": {
    "item_type": "file",
    "item_id": "8903212345",
    "item_name": "example.docx",
    "parent": {
      "type": "folder",
      "name": "All Files",
      "id": "0"
    },
    "owned_by": {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "11446498",
      "name": "Aaron Levie",
      "login": "notifications@example.com"
    },
    "classification": {
      "name": "Top Secret"
    }
  }
}
```
