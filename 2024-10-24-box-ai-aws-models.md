# Box AI API - AWS AI models now available

The list of [available AI models][1] has been recently updated with the following AWS models:

* AWS Claude 3 Sonnet
* AWS Claude 3.5 Sonnet
* AWS Claude 3 Haiku
* AWS Titan Text Lite

The AWS models are currently in **Preview** mode, which means you can use the model, but you may encounter quality, availability, and latency issues.

You can use the provided models to [override the default model][1] used in the AI agent configuration.
For further details on Box AI API, see the [guides][2] and [API reference][3].
