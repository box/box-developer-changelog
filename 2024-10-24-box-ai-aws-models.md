The list of [available AI models][1] has been recently updated with the following AWS models:

* AWS Claude 3 Sonnet

Models offered in **Preview** mode have not been fully performance-tested at scale and are made available on an as-is basis. You may experience variability in model/output quality, availability, and accuracy.

You can use the provided models to [override the default model][1] used in the AI agent configuration.
