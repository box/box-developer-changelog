# Update to Box Annotations

We will be introducing two enhancements to the annotations features available
via the Box API that your customer uses in their custom application. The
updates are as follows:

* **Point Annotations mode**: We are enhancing point annotations by introducing
  Point Annotations mode. This allows users to expediently add annotations on a
  document without having to re-select the point annotation icon after each
  annotation. [here](guide://embed/ui-elements).
* **Drawing Annotations via Expiring Embed**: We launched Drawing Annotations
  in November of 2017. This provided end users the ability to free-form draw on
  their touch-enabled devices using touch or a stylus. We are excited to share
  that we're making Drawing Annotations Full release announcement is available
  via the Expiring Embed. Users using annotations via the Get Embed Link API will
  now have a whole new way to express themselves via Box Preview.
