# Introducing enhanced My Apps view in Developer Console

To improve application management experience even further, we introduce
the [My Apps][1] list view in the Developer Console.
This view includes key information about your applications, giving you the possibility to:

* view and copy the application client ID,
* view the application description,
* sort custom applications,
* check the authorization and enablement status of the application,
* access the configuration and generate developer tokens.

<!-- more -->

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to our [developer forum][2] for any help needed.
