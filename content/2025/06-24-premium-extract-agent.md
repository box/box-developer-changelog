# Enhanced extract agent

Today we introduced the new enhanced extract agent powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro. It employs chain-of-thought
processing to provide the best answer, but also to tell the developer the reason it believes this answer is the correct one.

Premium extract agent:

* Offers an improved key-value pair extraction from complex documents with higher accuracy.
* Effortless access with Box UI: activate the feature with a single click.
* Transforms unstructured data into meaningful metadata attached to files.
* Enables faster insights and discovery using the Box Metadata search tool.

Go to the Autofilling Metadata in Templates section in our [product documentation][1] to learn more about its capabilities.
