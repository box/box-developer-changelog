# New developer documentation site (beta)

We are exited to announce the beta launch of the new Box developer documentation site at `developer.box.com`. This release provides early access to the redesigned, AI-first, purpose-built developer experience platform for Box Developer Guides and API Reference.

<!-- more -->

## What’s included in this beta launch

New design aligned with developer workflows:

* Refreshed homepage
* Intuitive landing pages
* Interactive API testing experience
* Improved readability and accessibility:
* Enhanced navigation
* Clear, responsive book structure with global and single-page tables of contents
* Light and dark modes

AI-first functionality:

* AI-powered search with generative answers and aggregated results from across Box sites
* Contextual menu options to integrate with leading AI tools and copy pages as Markdown
* Box Developer Documentation MCP server

## Launch plan

This beta launch focuses on Developer Guides and API Reference. The remaining content will be migrated from the current [box.dev](box.dev) site over the coming weeks. Throughout the process, both sites will be available and interlinked to ensure a smooth transition.

## Developer impact

We encourage you to test out the beta functionality and and share feedback. During the beta release, you can switch back to the [current developer documentation](https://box.dev/) site to engage with our content in the environment that you know best. For users of the Japanese version, switch back to [localized version](https://ja.developer.box.com/).

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to our [developer forum](https://community.box.com/box-platform-5) for any help needed.
