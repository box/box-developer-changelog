# Box SDKs major version

Introducing a new major release 


<!-- more -->

## Overview

Box core SDK packages are currently available in two major supported versions:
 * A version that follows sequential versioning for each SDK artifact. It includes two packages â€” the manually maintained package and the generated package. The coexisting packages support gradual migration to the generated one and provide easy access to the latest Box API features.
 * Version 10, a consistent version number across all Box SDK artifacts.

For additional information and guidanece visit [Box SDK versioning strategy page][1].

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to our [developer forum][2] or report issues directly in the individual Box SDK repositories on GitHub.
