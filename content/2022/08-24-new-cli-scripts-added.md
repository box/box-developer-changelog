# Updates to Box CLI

The recent additions to [Box CLI script library][1] and [CLI guides][2]
improve automation even further and simplify handling repetitive tasks.

<!-- more -->

## New CLI scripts

The sample scripts library now includes the following scripts for you to use:

* [Provision users and folders][3] builds an
onboarding folder structure and adds users.
* [Manage groups and collaborations][4] creates or updates groups, add users to them, and finally add groups to folders as collaborators.
* [Report inactive users][5] generates a CSV file with a list of users who have been inactive for a specific number of days.
* [Update user zones][6] provisions users to a specific 
data residency zone within a Multizone Box tenant.
* [Deprovision users][7] deprovisions users and deletes them.

## Bulk commands guide

The [bulk commands guide][8] shows you how you can perform actions for multiple items at once.
