# Box Sign API supports setting redirect URLs

The [Box Sign API][3] now offers new parameters to set up custom redirect URLs
for users who sign or decline a sign request. This way, when integrating your application 
with Box Sign, you can redirect the signers
back to your application or display a custom landing page.

<!-- more -->

## Updates

Box Sign API provides optional parameters to pass in the request body of the [Create Sign Request][3] call:

* `redirect_url` that redirects the user to a specific page after signing a request
* `declined_redirect_url` that redirects the user to a specific page after declining a request

You can define redirect URLs globally for all signers and for specific signers only.
For details, see the [Create Sign Request][4] guide.
