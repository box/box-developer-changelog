# Announcing SDK Supported Versions

Only the current **major** version of a SDK is supported. New features,
functionality, bug fixes, and security updates will only be added to the
current **major** version.

<!-- more -->

A current release is on the leading edge of our SDK development, and is intended for customers who are in active development and want the latest and greatest features.
Instead of stating a release date for a new feature, we set a fixed minor or patch release cadence of maximum 2-3 months (while we may release more often). At the same
time, there is no schedule for major or breaking release. Instead, we will communicate one quarter in advance the upcoming breaking change to allow customers to plan for
the upgrade. We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use. We highly recommend upgrading to the latest
SDK major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.

We use a modified version of [Semantic Versioning][2] for all changes. See
[version strategy][3] for details which is effective from 30 July 2022.
