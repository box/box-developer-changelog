# New Powershell scripts templates for the Box CLI

<!--alex ignore -->
Using the Box CLI just got so much easier! By itself, the CLI is already
powerful, but using it alongside a Powershell script lets you complete
repetitive tasks quickly!

<!-- more -->

Using our [first script template][4], you can provisioning users and create
their initial folder tree. More scripts will be added in the coming months.  

## Updates
* Added a [new step][2] to our Box CLI quick start guide
* Added a new [examples folder][3] to the Box CLI GitHub repository 

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][1] for any help needed.
