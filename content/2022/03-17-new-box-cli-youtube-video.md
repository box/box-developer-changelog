# New Box CLI YouTube Video 

Back in February, we [launched][3] the OAuth 2.0 version of the Box CLI, alongside
new YouTube content. Today, we released [video 2][4] of the series. It shows
using the built in help functionality to create a folder with the CLI.

<!-- more -->

You can find the Box Platform and Developer Playlist on [YouTube][2]. We have two
more videos planned: Advanced Topics (including as-user) and CLI Automation
using PowerShell.

Make sure to [subscribe][5] to the Box Channel to get all the latest content!

## Where to get support
