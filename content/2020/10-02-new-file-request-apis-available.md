# New File Request APIs available

A new collection of APIs are now available that allows
developers to create and update File Requests. We've
updated the [reference documentation][copy] and added
[new guides][guides] to help you manage your file requests.

To create a copy of an existing file request, all you need is
the unique ID of an existing file request, and the ID of the
folder to apply the new request to.

```curl
curl -i -X POST "https://api.box.com/2.0/file_requests/42037322/copy" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
     -d '{
       "folder": {
         "id": "2233212"
       }
     }'
```

Additional APIs are available that allow a developer to get more details
about a file request, update a file request, and delete a file request.
For more details, please check out the developer documentation.
