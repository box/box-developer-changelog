# Search API adds support for Shared Links

The [Search API][endpoint] now supports returning files, 
folders and web links that the user has recently accessed
through a shared link.

Shared items can be requested by calling the 
[`GET /search`][endpoint] API with the new 
`include_recent_shared_links` query parameter set to `true`.

```sh
curl -i -X GET https://api.box.com/2.0/search?query=Contract&include_recent_shared_link=true
```

By default, the API won't return any shared items if this
query parameter is not provided or not set to true.


## Change in response format

When `include_recent_shared_links` is set to `true`, the
response has slightly changed to allow for the additional
information to be returned. Rather than returning a direct list
of files, folders, and web links the API now returns a list of
objects containing an `item` and an `accessible_via_shared_link`
property.

This change in response format should not impact any existing applications
as it only applies to any API call made with the new query parameter.
