# New Zip Download APIs available

A new collection of APIs are now available that allows developers to create a
Zip file containing a specified list of files and folders. We've updated the
reference documentation for this [Zip Download API][zip_downloads_api]. SDK
support for these new endpoints is currently in development and scheduled
to be released in the next 3 months.
