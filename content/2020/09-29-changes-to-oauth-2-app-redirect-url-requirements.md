# Change to OAuth 2 app redirect URI requirements

On October 29th, 2020, Box will begin employing stricter requirements for
redirect URIs used within new and existing
[OAuth 2](g://authentication/oauth2/)-based Box integrations that may affect
your application.

Existing application owners that currently use a blank redirect URI in their
application configuration, as
[described here](g://applications/custom-apps/oauth2-setup/#redirect-uri), will
need to update the redirect URI to match the redirect used within the code
redirect step,
[described here](g://authentication/oauth2/with-sdk/#2-redirect-user). 

On October 29th, 2020, applications that are still configured with a blank URI
will begin returning an error when the user is redirected back to your
application if URI adjustments aren't made.

All impacted application owners and collaborators have been notified via
the email address associated with their developer account.

## How to validate and make the change
To validate your redirect URI and update your application(s) if they are
affected, take the following steps:

* Go to the
 [Box developer console](https://cloud.app.box.com/developers/console) as the
 user who owns the application(s).
* For each **Custom App** using **OAuth 2** (client-side authentication) click
 on the application to open it.
* From the left navigation, click on **Configuration**.
* Scroll down to the **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI** section.Â 
* For any application where this URI is blank, add the URI that is being used
 in the application code when redirecting the user back to your application
 from the Box auth step,
 [as is described in this guide](g://authentication/oauth2/with-sdk/#2-redirect-user).
