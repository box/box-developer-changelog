# Change to enterprise events for content access

Starting today, the [enterprise event stream](g://events/enterprise-events/for-enterprise/) will
begin producing new content access events.

A new `CONTENT_ACCESS` event is triggered when a file was accessed by an
authorized user or programmatically by a Box application. 

See the [enterprise events](g://events/enterprise-events/for-enterprise/) documentation
for more information on other event types.
