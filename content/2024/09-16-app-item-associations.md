# App item associations

The [app item associations API][1] allows you to check which app items are connected with a specific file or folder, including the app items associated with ancestors of the file or folder.

<!-- more -->


An [app item][2] is a content object owned by an application. It can group files and folders together from different paths. That set can be shared through a collaboration.

An [app item association][3] is a connection between a file or folder and an app item. Associations between a folder and an app item cascade down to all descendants of the folder.

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to our [developer forum][4] for any help needed.
