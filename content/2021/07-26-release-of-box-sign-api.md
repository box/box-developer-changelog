# Release of Box Sign API

Today, July 26th, 2021, beings the roll out of Box Sign! Programmatically
harness the full functionality of the [Box Sign web app experience][webapp] by
leveraging our newest API endpoints to create, list, resend, and cancel Box Sign
requests.

While Box Sign does not need to be enabled by an Admin to use its API endpoints,
it does need to be rolled out to your enterprise. We will notify Admins as it
becomes available for their Box instance.

<!-- more -->

At a minimum, creating a Box Sign request requires selecting a file for
signature, a destination folder for the signed document/[signing log][log], and
designating signers. At this time, only one file can be signed per request.

```curl 
curl -i -X PUT "https://api.box.com/2.0/sign_requests" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
     -d '{
       "signers": [
          {    
            "role": "signer",
            "email": "example_email@box.com"
          }
        ],
       "source_files": [
          {
            "type": "file",
            "id": "123456789"
          }
       ],
       "parent_folder": 
          {
            "type": "folder",
            "id": "0987654321"
          }
     }'
```
