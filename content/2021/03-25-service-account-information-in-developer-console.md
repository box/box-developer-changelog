# Service Account email added to Developer Console

Upon Admin authorization of an application leveraging server authentication,
the auto-generated email address of the Service Account is now surfaced in the
General tab of the Developer Console. This email address can then be used to
collaborate the user on Box content. The format will always be
`AutomationUser_AppServiceID_RandomString@boxdevedition.com`. For example, 
`AutomationUser_123456_6jCo6Pqwo@boxdevedition.com`. 

To learn more, see our guide on [User Types][ut] and [Service Accounts][sa].
