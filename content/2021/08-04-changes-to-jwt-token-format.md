# Upcoming change to JWT format

On August 4th, 2021, as part of our continued infrastructure upgrades, we will
begin deployment of a change that may affect custom applications leveraging
Server Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Potential impact will require additional verification from customers who do not
use an official [Box SDK][box-sdks] and are storing tokens in a database.

All customers and application owners who are potentially impacted have been
notified directly via email.

## Change overview

This change may only impact applications leveraging Server Authentication with
JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Tokens will continue to return as a string as stated in
our [documentation][tokendoc]. However, the format will be longer and contain
<!--alex ignore special-->
special characters. 

An example of a token returned today: `NXWd9KDPVofXQKZJlQjICCWFHEmuOihs`. 

After this change, tokens will return in the following format: 

`1!yxxhRreQCKcEbC_ZfYvPudyLe7Ed36gIQcqqZo2pfaVZyxNBkQjoHk0fgA1iTY3_uwXgif-hg-gne

-Tso7xdHd9rW0FXsu024U7dMNuQ6kpP1_kJI2Y`. 

Please note that this is not a new format to Box, as this format is currently
returned when [downscoping tokens][downscope]. 

## Verifying application impact

1. Navigate to **Admin Console** > **Apps** Tab > **Custom Apps**.
2. Click **View** for each app row listed
3. Scroll to the bottom of the app details page and verify the selected
  authentication method. Affected apps will say
  **Server Authentication with JSON Web Tokens**. 

For each application identified above, you will need to determine: 

1. Is it using an official [Box SDK][box-sdks]? If so, no further action is
  required to prepare for this change. While it is always best practice to be
  on the latest version, no minimum versions are required for compatibility.

<!--alex ignore special-->
2. If an official SDK is not used, are tokens stored in a database? If so, you
  will need to preform additional verification that the database can handle both
  the new length and special characters.

## Testing before release

If you have identified an application that leverages Server Authentication with
JWT and stores tokens in a database, you will want to preform the test below 
before August 4th. 

As mentioned above, the new format for tokens is currently used when
[downscoping tokens][downscope]. Therefore, preform the following steps to 
assess impact: 

1. Generate an Access Token for the application
<!--alex ignore special-->
2. [Downscope][downscope] the token from step 1
<!--alex ignore special-->
3. Attempt to store the downscoped token in your database

If you are successfully able to store the token in the database no further
action is necessary to prepare for this change.

<!--alex ignore special-->
If you are unable to store the token, your database must be updated to support
the additional length and special characters.
