# Box Shield Smart Access events


External collaboration restriction and justification approval events are now
available via the [enterprise events][events] stream. 

[Box Shield][box-shield] must be purchased and enabled on a Box enterprise in
order to take advantage of these advanced security offerings.

These events follow the standard [event object][eo] schema, with the
`event_type` value set of:
`SHIELD_EXTERNAL_COLLAB_INVITE_BLOCKED_MISSING_JUSTIFICATION`, 
`SHIELD_EXTERNAL_COLLAB_INVITE_JUSTIFIED`, 
`SHIELD_EXTERNAL_COLLAB_INVITE_BLOCKED`
`SHIELD_EXTERNAL_COLLAB_ACCESS_BLOCKED_MISSING_JUSTIFICATION`,
`SHIELD_EXTERNAL_COLLAB_ACCESS_BLOCKED`, or
`SHIELD_JUSTIFICATION_APPROVAL`.

The `additional_details` payload of each event provides more information. Full
details can be found in our [Shield Events [guide][saguide].
