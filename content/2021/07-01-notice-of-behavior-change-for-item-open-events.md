# Notice of behavior change for item open events

Starting today, we will begin rolling out changes to the behavior
of `ITEM_OPEN` events when an application consumes those events from our
[event API endpoint][event-apis].

This change will only affect the `ITEM_OPEN` [enterprise event][user-events].
The new behavior will not cause downtime within existing applications or
require any application changes to prevent uptime disruptions.

## Change overview

Within the previous behavior when events were consumed, opened item events were
surfaced through the `ITEM_OPEN` event type for the owner of the content as
well as any contributors assigned to the content. This meant that if a file with
2000 collaborators on it was opened, say on Drive, the file owner plus all
2000 collaborators would have an event created stating that the file was opened.

With the new behavior, notification of an item being opened will only be created
for the owner of the content and will not be produced for collaborators. This
will help to reduce the noise of the event stream while preserving the ability
to see when items are opened as a content owner.

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][forum] for any help needed.
