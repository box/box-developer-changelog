# Annotations available for Excel files in preview

Currently, annotations capabilities don't appear within Excel files in preview,
either via the
[Box UI Content Preview element](guide://embed/ui-elements) or
expiring embed, even if annotations are enabled (`showAnnotations=true`).

Starting on **September 13th, 2018**, users will be able to annotate Excel
files like they can other file types (PDFs, docs, PPT). All 3 annotation
types (highlight, point, and drawing) will be supported. If `showAnnotations`
is set to `true` annotations on Excel files will be displayed.
