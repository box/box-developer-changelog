# New Box Open With Sidebar UI Element

We have released an open beta version of a new Box UI Element, the 'Open With'
element. 'Open With' will allow developers to embed a menu to open content
stored in box with a partner application. The partners available with this beta
release are Adobe Sign and G Suite.

Documentation and setup instructions for this new element are
[available here](guide://embed/ui-elements).
