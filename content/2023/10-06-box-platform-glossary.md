# Introducing Box Platform Glossary

To improve your experience with Box Platform and Box documentation, we created the [Box Platform Glossary][1].
You can find there terms and concepts that are most important to start working with Box content- and cloud-based solutions.

<!-- more -->

As we want this list of terms to be comprehensive and detailed, it will be regularly updated. Let us know if you have any suggestions!

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to our [developer forum][2] for any help needed.
