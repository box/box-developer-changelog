# Updates to Box Embed guide

With [Box Embed][1] you can embed a Box webapp anywhere
in your application. The updated webapp is responsive to
any changes. For example, if an integration makes the embedded
Box webapp smaller, all the UI components such as buttons and
lists will also be resized to still be usable.

The update also includes a description of the cloud game,
which increases security by preventing clickjacking attacks.

# Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please
