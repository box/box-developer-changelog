# Introducing Embedded Sign Client

You can now use [Box Embed][1] to embed Box Sign
features in your own website. This way, users
don't have to leave the website, go to Box Sign
to sign the document, and then come back to finish
the process. Instead, Box Embed allows them
to complete the signing process
within the external website.

To integrate Box Sign experience within your
own website, you need the [`iframeable_embed_url`][2]
parameter that is specifically designed to allow
signing documents within the HTML `iframe` tag.
