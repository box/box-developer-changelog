# Platform Activity CSV report

A report has been made available in the Box Admin Console that displays an
enterprise's utilization of platform resources. The first version of this
report displays integration into the total number of API calls to the Box
existing Content API by day effective April 1st, 2018. Future iterations of
this report will display additional resource consumption (Monthly Active Users,
bandwidth, and storage) by service and will also include historical data. For
more information, please see the [Running Reports article in Box
Community][community].
