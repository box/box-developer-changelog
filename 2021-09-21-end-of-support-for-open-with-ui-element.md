# EOS for Open With UI Element and EOL for Adobe Sign

Today, the [Open With UI element][owuie] can integrate with Box Tools, Google
Workspace, and Adobe Sign. In an effort to continuously improve the Box
experience, we are focusing our resources on new features and functionality that
better align with our users' evolving needs.

December 21, 2021 the following changes will occur:

* We will discontinue support of the Box Open With UI Element for Box Tools and
  Google Workspace for any new customers. A new customer is any customer not using
  this element prior to December 21. Any customers leveraging the Open With UI
  Element with Box Tools and/or Google Workspace prior to December 21 are
  considered existing customers and will continue to receive support until further
  notice. The Box Tools and Google Workspace Web App functionality will not be
  impacted.

* Adobe Sign will no longer be available for use by new or existing customers
  via the Open With UI element or Web Application.

Should you have any further questions, please contact us by opening a
[support][support] ticket or posting on the [developer forum][forum].
