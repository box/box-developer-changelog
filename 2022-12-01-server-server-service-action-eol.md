# Server-side actions no longer supported in Web App Integrations

On December 1st, the options to create a preliminary callback URL or a server-side integration will no longer be available for OAuth 2.0 web app integration.
<!-- more -->

## Next steps

If you have the server-side integration already configured for your applications, it will still be working.
If you wish to stop using the feature or perform adjustments in your settings, see [this document][2] for workaround options and support.

For more information about web app integrations, see the [documentation][3].

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][1] for any help needed.
