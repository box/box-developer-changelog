# End of Support for Obsolete Language Versions

As Box to prepares to release the next major versions of the Python and
Java SDKs, this is an alert that support is ending for obsolete language
versions.

<!-- more -->

On January 17, 2022, major releases of the [Python][2] and [Java][3] SDK
libraries are planned, ending support for obsolete language versions. The Python
SDK will abandon Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 starting from version `v3.0.0` of the
Python SDK. The Java SDK will abandon Java 7 starting from version `v3.0.0` of
the Java SDK. Applications using the Python or Java SDK can still use the
respective older versions of those libraries located in the [GitHub][4]
release section, but any future new features will not be available for use.

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][1] for any help needed. You can also connect with the SDK
team on the respective GitHub repository.
